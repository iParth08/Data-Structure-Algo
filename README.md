## Data Structure

### Array


### String


### Vector


## Technique to Solve

> **01. Naive Move** - Follow instructions

- Apply Brute force approach
- Force out a solution by simple traversal, loop, etc..
- Direct application of algorithms
  
> **02. Morphism** - Exploit and modify 

- A little modification to base algorithm
- A more optimized and convient solution


> **03. Search Space** - Define your lookup domain

- Define when a single value is too be found within a contiguous range
- When value has to be **minimized or maximized**
- Value may later be checked against **condition of generation**
- Generator is insignificant in output, beware before modifying it.
