# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Time Complexity
*Time taken by an algorithm as a function of **length of input***
- comparison is platform/system independent
- a standard for selecting better approach
  
### Worst Case O(..)
- only higher power is considered
- represent the worst case upper bound
  
1. **Loops**
   - loop in loop   : multiplication
   - loop and loop  : addition
  
2. **Recursive**
   - Convert into T-function
     - [Tree Method](https://www.javatpoint.com/daa-recursion-tree-method)

## Technique to Solve

> **01. Naive Move** - Follow instructions

- Apply Brute force approach
- Force out a solution by simple traversal, loop, etc..
- Direct application of algorithms
  
> **02. Morphism** - Exploit and modify 

- A little modification to base algorithm
- A more optimized and convient solution


> **03. Search Space** - Define your lookup domain

- Define when a single value is too be found within a contiguous range
- When value has to be **minimized or maximized**
- Value may later be checked against **condition of generation**
- Generator is insignificant in output, beware before modifying it. 

> **04. Two-Pointer Approach** - Place and move two cursors

- Make two cursors to track two different position
- Works well with While-loop
- When working with two arrays or sorting/selecting

> **05. Sliding Window** -
