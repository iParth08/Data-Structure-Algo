## Concepts of Sorting

| **Sorting Algo**  | **TimeComplexity** | *Approach*                         | *UseCASE*                             |

| 1. Selection Sort | **O(N^2)**         | Place min to a selected place      | Small Size                            |
| 2. Bubble Sort    | **O(N^2)** / O(N)  | Every round, max move to its place | (MOD) Small Size                      |
| 3. Insertion Sort | **O(N^2)** / O(N)  | Place next elm in pre-sorted part  | Adaptive Algorithm (Partially Sorted) |
